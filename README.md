Npackd Devbox Package Repository
================================

Packages in this repository are public tools, well known to everybody. We are using these packages for internal purposes in
FirstBeatMedia Devbox development environment.

After researching other package managers like Chocolatey, CoApp or 0install,
we decided to use [Npackd](https://code.google.com/p/windows-package-manager/)
as an application manager for Windows.
